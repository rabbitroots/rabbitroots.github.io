you taught me the courage of stars before you left
how light carries on endlessly, even after death
with shortness of breath, you explained the infinite
how rare and beautiful it is to even exist

i couldn't help but ask you to say it all again
i tried to write it down but i could never find a pen
i'd give anything to hear you say it one more time
that the universe was made just to be seen by my eyes
